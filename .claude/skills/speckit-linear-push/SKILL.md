## Summary

Reconcile every `specs/NNN-feature/` directory in the consumer repo
into Linear (filesystem → Linear, idempotent, drift-aware — writes from
any worktree, warns on backward-drift, never blocks).

Reconcile the consumer repo's `specs/NNN-feature/` directories into
Linear. This is the load-bearing path that mirrors filesystem state
into Linear Issues, task-phase sub-issues, checklists, blocking
relations, clarify-session comments, and lifecycle-phase labels.

**Direction**: one-way, filesystem → Linear (Principle I).
**Semantics**: idempotent (Principle II — zero-churn on unchanged
state, SC-002).
**Authority**: drift-aware (Constitution Principle IV v2.0.0). ANY
worktree may write a spec's Linear state regardless of its current git
branch (FR-051) — the invoking worktree's filesystem is the write
authority. The v1.0.0 FR-025 branch-gate is REMOVED. Before each write
the reconciler computes a backward-drift signal (FR-052) from
lifecycle-phase ordering and spec-dir git-commit recency; on
backward-drift (Linear appears ahead of disk) it surfaces a structured
WARNING row (FR-054) and lets the operator decide — interactively it
prompts proceed/abort, non-interactively it proceeds-and-warns by
default (override with `on-drift=abort`). It NEVER refuses the write of
its own accord (warn, don't block). Forward / no-drift writes proceed
silently. Spec 003 (`003-drift-aware-authority`, FR-051..FR-064)
implements this. FR-026's current-state surfacing obligation is
retained (FR-060): `speckit.linear.status` shows Linear's view from any
worktree without writing. See the contracts:
[drift-warning-surface](../specs/003-drift-aware-authority/contracts/drift-warning-surface.md),
[recency-comparison](../specs/003-drift-aware-authority/contracts/recency-comparison.md),
[drift-detection-graphql](../specs/003-drift-aware-authority/contracts/drift-detection-graphql.md).
**Layer**: this command implements Layer D. The GitHub Action template
that ships with `/spec-kit-linear-install` implements Layer E and is
out of scope here.

The deterministic work happens in `src/reconcile.sh`; this command is
the AI-agent entry point that runs the shell and surfaces its output.
The formal API contract is `contracts/command-shapes.md` §1
(`speckit.linear.push`); the mutations issued are enumerated in
`contracts/linear-graphql-mutations.md` §4. Operators reading this
file are looking at the markdown the AI agent reads — the same
operations are available via `bash src/reconcile.sh` directly. For
the operator-facing end-to-end walkthrough see
[`quickstart.md`](../specs/001-spec-kit-linear-bridge/quickstart.md).

## Usage

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `spec` | (none — uses `--all`) | Feature number (e.g. `003`). Reconcile only this spec. |
| `dry-run` | false | Log every mutation that WOULD fire; issue none. Safe inspection mode. |
| `retroactive` | false | **DEPRECATED** no-op alias (Constitution Principle IV v2.0.0 / spec 003 FR-061). Write-from-any-branch is now the default (FR-051), so this flag changes nothing behaviorally; it emits exactly one deprecation INFO row per invocation and still implies `--all` (the historical first-time-adoption convenience). A documented v0.1.1 command that still carries `--retroactive` runs identically to omitting it. Removed in a later release. |
| `on-drift` | (unset → proceed-and-warn) | `abort\|proceed` — non-interactive backward-drift disposition (FR-056). The default writes the disk state and records a WARNING row so CI logs stay auditable (hooks keep converging). `abort` skips drifted specs with a WARNING row + a skip note (`Linear unchanged`) instead of writing. Has no observable effect when no backward-drift fires. An unrecognised value is a usage error. |

Exactly one of `spec` or "all specs" is in effect — if `spec` is not
passed, the reconciler walks every `specs/NNN-*/` directory in the
consumer repo. If `retroactive` is set and `spec` is not, `--all` is
implied. `dry-run` is orthogonal to `retroactive` and `spec`.

### CLI shape

```text
speckit.linear.push [--spec NNN | --all] [--dry-run] [--retroactive]
```

Default: `--all`.

## Algorithm (what the AI agent executes)

1. **Verify prerequisites.** Refuse to proceed if any of these fail.
   - Bash 4 or newer is on `PATH`. Run `bash --version` and confirm
     the major version number is `≥ 4`. macOS ships bash 3.2 by
     default; the operator must `brew install bash` and ensure
     `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/bin/bash`
     (Intel) is earlier on `PATH` than `/bin/bash`.
   - The consumer repo's config is present at
     `.specify/extensions/linear/linear-config.yml`. If absent,
     surface "run `/spec-kit-linear-install` first" and exit; do NOT
     attempt to run the reconciler.
   - `jq` is installed (`command -v jq`). `curl` is installed
     (`command -v curl`). `git` is installed and the working directory
     is inside a git working tree.

2. **Compose the invocation.** Translate the user-facing arguments
   into `src/reconcile.sh` flags:
   - `spec=NNN` → `--spec NNN`
   - no `spec` and no `retroactive` → `--all`
   - `dry-run=true` → `--dry-run`
   - `retroactive=true` → `--retroactive`
   - Always pass `--quiet` UNLESS the user has explicitly asked for
     verbose output, since the structured summary is the
     operator-visible contract per FR-023.

3. **Execute the reconciler.** Shell out:

   ```bash
   bash src/reconcile.sh <flags>
   ```

   The script:
   - Loads + validates `linear-config.yml` (`src/config.sh`). On
     missing/malformed UUIDs it halts with exit 2 and an
     operator-actionable diagnostic (Principle VIII).
   - Enumerates the requested specs and processes each:
     - Applies write authority per Constitution Principle IV v2.0.0
       (drift-aware, spec 003): ANY worktree may write regardless of
       its current branch (FR-051) — the legacy FR-025 branch-gate is
       removed. The bridge computes a backward-drift signal and
       surfaces a WARNING row when Linear is ahead, but does not refuse
       the write (interactive prompt / non-interactive `on-drift`
       resolution decide proceed vs abort; the default is
       proceed-and-warn). Forward / no-drift writes proceed silently.
       The spec's current Linear state is surfaced read-only regardless
       (FR-026 / FR-060).
     - Infers the lifecycle phase from artifacts on disk
       (`spec.md` → `clarifying` → `planning` → `tasking` →
       `red_team` → `implementing` → `analyzing` → `ready_to_merge` →
       `merged`) per FR-012, with PR-state hints from
       `git_helpers::pr_state` (gh CLI → git-only branch-reachability
       fallback per FR-030) for the terminal `ready_to_merge` and
       `merged` states.
     - Find-or-creates the spec Issue by `speckit-spec:NNN` label
       scoped to the configured Project (FR-004b). On race
       (>1 match) keeps the most-recently-updated and surfaces the
       others as warnings. On retroactive sync sets `stateId`
       directly to the inferred end-state (FR-014).
     - Rewrites the spec Issue's description in canonical order
       (overview → memory block → diagrams) per FR-004. The bridge
       fully owns the description body; any prior content is
       discarded. Operator annotations belong in Linear comments per
       FR-008 (the canonical escape hatch the bridge never touches).
       The memory block surfaces lifecycle phase, current task phase,
       branch, worktree path(s), last-touched timestamp, the GitHub
       source link, operator assignee (FR-034), and the Fibonacci
       estimate rollup (FR-035).
     - Reconciles task-phase sub-issues per `## Phase N: <Name>`
       header in `tasks.md` (FR-005). Each sub-issue carries a
       checklist mirror with a read-only header (FR-006). Workflow
       state is Todo / In Progress / Done based on checklist
       completion ratio.
     - Wires inter-task-phase blocking relations (FR-007) by reading
       "Phase N depends on Phase M" hints from `plan.md` /
       `tasks.md`. Native `save_issue.blocks` per the MCP runtime
       probe; pre-queries existing relations to avoid duplicate-add.
     - Mirrors each `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` clarify block under
       `## Clarifications` to a Linear Issue comment, idempotent via
       a deterministic comment marker (FR-008 + FR-015).
     - Ensures the spec Issue carries `phase:<current>` and
       `speckit-spec:NNN` labels; strips stale `phase:*` labels.
       When phase is `merged`, no `phase:*` label is set (FR-013).
       FR-036 agent labels — see spec for stamping rules.

4. **Render the structured summary.** The script emits a block to
   stderr at the end of every invocation (FR-023). The block looks
   like:

   ```text
   ===== speckit.linear summary =====
   speckit.linear reconcile — spec 003
   Created: 1   Updated: 4   Archived: 0
   Skipped: 0   Warned: 1     Errors: 0
   ----- warnings -----
   - spec 003: 2 task line(s) outside any ## Phase header
   ==================================
   ```

   Surface this verbatim to the operator. The block IS the
   operator-visible result of the command per Principle VIII Rule 1.

5. **Handle the exit code.** Per `contracts/command-shapes.md` §1.6:
   - `0` — success (possibly with warnings). Report success; include
     the summary block verbatim.
   - `1` — partial failure. Some specs failed; others succeeded.
     Surface the warnings from the summary and recommend re-running
     `/speckit.linear.push spec=<NNN>` for any spec named in the
     warnings list.
   - `2` — workspace config error (per FR-022). The script halted
     before any mutation. Surface the exact remediation the script
     printed (typically: run `/spec-kit-linear-install` or
     `/spec-kit-linear-seed`). Do NOT retry automatically.
   - `3` — transport failure. Linear was unreachable; nothing was
     written. Recommend re-running once network connectivity is
     restored.

## When this command fires

- **Operator-driven.** `/speckit.linear.push` from the AI agent
  chat — the primary on-demand path for recovery from missed hooks
  and ad-hoc reconcile.
- **Auto-fired hooks** (post-install via `/spec-kit-linear-install`).
  Every `/speckit-*` lifecycle command in `.specify/extensions.yml`
  is wired to invoke this command per FR-031.
- **Local git hooks** (`post-checkout`, `post-commit`, `post-merge`)
  invoke `src/reconcile.sh` directly per FR-033, bypassing this
  markdown and skipping the prerequisite re-verification.

All three paths converge on `src/reconcile.sh` (FR-011 — same
outcome regardless of trigger).

## Output channel discipline

- `stdout` of `src/reconcile.sh` is reserved for future
  structured-output modes (none in v1) — it stays empty during a
  normal reconcile.
- `stderr` carries:
  - per-mutation log lines (suppressed by `--quiet`)
  - the final structured summary block (always, unless
    `sync.emit_summary: false` is set in `linear-config.yml`)
- No filesystem writes (Principle I + FR-016). The reconciler reads
  the spec directories, the config, and the git state; everything
  else flows out over the Linear API.

## Failure surface

Each failure mode is surfaced as a named warning in the summary
(Principle VIII) so the operator can act on it without trawling
logs:

- `spec NNN: spec.md missing or empty; skipping` — edge case from
  spec § 1. Reconcile continues with the next spec.
- `spec NNN: N task line(s) outside any ## Phase header` — FR-024.
  Tasks lacking a phase grouping are still flagged and the rest of
  the spec syncs.
- `duplicate spec Issues with label speckit-spec:NNN: kept <id>,
  archiving N loser(s)` — FR-004b race resolution. The most-recently
  -updated wins; losers are flagged for archival.
- `clarify-session DATE: existing comment body diverges from
  spec.md; not overwriting` — FR-015 + contracts §9. Hand-edits to
  comments are preserved; the reconciler does not silently overwrite.
- `spec NNN backward-drift: disk=<phase>  linear=<phase>
  signals=<csv>` — Principle IV v2.0.0 (drift-aware, spec 003) WARNING
  row: Linear appears ahead of the invoking worktree's disk state. It
  surfaces the drift but does NOT block the write; the operator decides
  (interactive prompt, or `on-drift` non-interactively — default
  proceed-and-warn). This REPLACES the removed v1.0.0
  `non-authoritative worktree … read-only mode` skip. A recency-signal
  drift appends a detail line naming the spec-dir last-commit time vs
  Linear's `updatedAt`.
- `spec NNN skipped by operator (backward-drift abort) — Linear
  unchanged` — the operator (or `on-drift=abort`) chose to skip a
  drifted spec; zero Linear mutation for that spec (FR-057).
- `linear-config.yml not found at <path>; run
  /spec-kit-linear-install` — FR-022 halt. Exit code 2.
