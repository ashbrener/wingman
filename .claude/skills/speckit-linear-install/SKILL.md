## Summary

Per-consumer-repo install ceremony — verify dependencies, resolve
Team + Project UUIDs (Principle V — UUID binding), wire OAuth-first
MCP auth (Principle VI), register `after_*` hooks, install local git
hooks.

Run the per-consumer-repo install ceremony for the spec-kit-linear
bridge. This is the load-bearing one-shot ceremony that wires a fresh
consumer repo to its Linear workspace: dependencies are verified, the
per-repo `linear-config.yml` is written, the six `after_*` hooks are
registered with `optional: false` (FR-031), and the three local git
hooks land under `.git/hooks/` (FR-033). The structured dependency
report it emits is the operator's contract per FR-018b — silent
failures are forbidden.

**Direction**: filesystem-side wiring only (Principle I).
**Idempotency**: re-running preserves operator edits — existing
`enabled: false` flags on registered hooks survive (Principle VII);
existing Project UUIDs are not overwritten without operator action.
**Authority**: this command never mutates Linear (other than the
optional `--auto-create` Project bootstrap, which is deferred to T077
dogfood). Workspace seeding (workflow states, labels) is a separate
command — `/spec-kit-linear-seed`.
**Layer**: implements the install side of Layer D. The optional
`--with-action` flag drops the Layer E template; the secret
provisioning (`gh secret set LINEAR_API_TOKEN`) stays with the
operator per FR-029.

The deterministic work happens in `src/install.sh`; this command is
the AI-agent entry point that runs the shell and surfaces its output.
The formal API contract is `contracts/command-shapes.md` §5
(`speckit.linear.install`). Operators reading this file are looking
at the markdown the AI agent reads — the same operations are
available via `bash src/install.sh` directly. The constitutional
gates governing this ceremony are `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
Principle V (UUID binding — all state references resolve through
captured UUIDs, never names) and Principle VI (OAuth-first auth —
long-lived keys live only at the edges). For the operator-facing
end-to-end walkthrough see
[`quickstart.md`](../specs/001-spec-kit-linear-bridge/quickstart.md).

## Usage

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `project` | (interactive prompt) | Existing Linear Project UUID. Mutually exclusive with `auto-create`. |
| `auto-create` | false | Create a new Linear Project named after the repo basename. Mutually exclusive with `project`. |
| `team` | auto-detect / prompt | Linear Team UUID. Required if `non-interactive=true`. |
| `non-interactive` | false | Refuse to prompt; require `project` (or `auto-create`) and `team` to be set on the CLI. Suitable for CI re-runs. |
| `with-action` | (interactive prompt) | Also drop `.specify/templates/github-action.yml` into `.github/workflows/spec-kit-linear-sync.yml` per FR-027, and surface the FR-029 secret-provisioning command. When neither `with-action` nor `no-action` is passed, interactive installs prompt the operator (T064); non-interactive runs default to install at the canonical path. |
| `no-action` | false | Explicitly suppress the Layer E Action install (skips both the T064 prompt and any default install behaviour). |
| `dev` | false | Install from the local spec-kit-linear checkout — used when the bridge is dogfooding its own repo (T077). |

`project` and `auto-create` are mutually exclusive (passing both
exits 2). `non-interactive` without one of them, or without `team`,
also exits 2. `non-interactive` is also accepted as `--no-prompt` for
parity with other speckit extensions.

### Environment

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SPECKIT_LINEAR_DOGFOOD_SAFE` | When set to `1` / `true` / `yes` / `on`, the install proceeds in dogfood-safe mode (FR-033b). The dependency report and the final summary both surface a `dogfood-safe mode active` row so the operator can confirm at a glance the safety override is engaged. Use when installing the bridge into a repo whose Linear workspace already carries spec issues for this project (typical of dogfood-on-itself or reinstall-after-abort flows). The same variable also gates the auto-fire hooks the bridge registers (T048 — `condition: "${SPECKIT_LINEAR_DOGFOOD_SAFE:-false}"`) so a single env var governs both install-time and hook-fire-time safety. |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Read from `.env` (or shell env) at install time so the FR-034 operator-identity resolver (`viewer { id name email }`) and the optional inline seed step (T063) can talk to Linear. Required for the seed-prompt accept path; the install halts with a clear remediation row if missing. |

## Algorithm (what the AI agent executes)

1. **Compose the invocation.** Translate the user-facing arguments
   into `src/install.sh` flags:
   - `project=<UUID>` → `--project <UUID>`
   - `auto-create=true` → `--auto-create` (soft-deprecated in v0.1.1;
     the new interactive default flow's "Create new project" picker
     option supersedes it — preserved bit-for-bit for CI / scripted
     installs per
     [`install-flags.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-flags.md)
     §2)
   - `team=<UUID>` → `--team <UUID>`
   - `non-interactive=true` → `--non-interactive` (also `--no-prompt`)
   - `with-action=true` → `--with-action`
   - `no-action=true` → `--no-action`
   - `dev=true` → `--dev`

2. **Execute the install ceremony.** Shell out:

   ```bash
   bash src/install.sh <flags>
   ```

   The script drives the discovery state machine (spec 002
   [`data-model.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/data-model.md)
   §4):

   - **S0 — safety guards.** Run
     `install::detect_self_install` (FR-046) and
     `install::detect_vendored_git` (FR-049). Source equals target →
     halt exit 2 with the
     [`install-flags.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-flags.md)
     §4 verbatim message. Vendored `.git/` present → emit a
     `summary::add warned` row with the `rm -rf …` remediation and
     continue (Principle VIII — operator consent; no auto-delete).
   - **S0b — dependency report (FR-018b).** Emit each row as
     `✓ <label>  <detail>` (verified), `⚠ <label>  <detail>`
     (warning; install proceeds), or `✗ <label>  <detail>` (hard
     error; install aborts with exit 2 after the full report is
     printed). Covered surfaces: bash, curl, jq, git, gh (optional),
     `.mcp.json` Linear MCP entry, Linear MCP OAuth cache,
     `.specify/` layout, `.git/hooks/` writability, `.env`.
   - **S1 — API key resolution (FR-037).**
     `install::prompt_for_api_key` walks the resolution order
     per
     [`install-prompts.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-prompts.md)
     §2:
     1. `LINEAR_API_KEY` env var (highest precedence).
     2. `.env` line at repo root.
     3. Interactive `read -r -s` prompt with echo suppressed.
     On (3) the install prompts "Save to .env?" (default Y); on
     accept it appends `LINEAR_API_KEY=…` and ensures `.env` is in
     `.gitignore`. Existing `.env` entries trigger the
     `[overwrite/keep/abort]` triage prompt (§2.4 / spec.md Edge
     Case 8). EOF on the key prompt halts with exit 2.
   - **S2 — viewer verification (FR-038 / FR-048).**
     `install::resolve_operator` issues exactly ONE
     `viewer { id name email organization { name urlKey } }` query
     per
     [`install-discovery-graphql.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-discovery-graphql.md)
     §1. The same response feeds:
     - The API-key-valid gate (`viewer == null` → halt exit 2 with
       the "create a new key at
       <https://linear.app/settings/api>" remediation).
     - The `linear.operator.{user_id, name, email}` block in
       `linear-config.yml` (FR-034).
     - The `linear.workspace.{name, url_key}` block.
     - The authorization for the next `teams` query (no second
       round trip).
   - **S3 — team discovery (FR-039).**
     `install::discover_teams` issues `teams(first: 21)` (one over
     the 20-shown ceiling — research.md §1 overflow probe).
     `install::pick_team_interactively` then renders the numbered
     `%2d) %-8s — %s` list and prompts. Behaviour matrix:
     - 0 teams → halt exit 2 with the FR-039 / spec.md Edge Case 1
       remediation.
     - 1 team → auto-pick + surface row "Found 1 team accessible —
       using <key> (<name>) (auto-picked)". No prompt.
     - 2-20 teams → numbered list + `Pick a team [1-N]:` prompt.
     - >20 teams → first 20 + warning row "and N-20 more not shown;
       pass --team <UUID> to install non-interactively" (Clarifications
       Q2 + spec.md Edge Case 2).

     `--team <UUID>` short-circuits S3 entirely (FR-044 fast path).
   - **S4 — project discovery (FR-040).**
     `install::discover_projects` issues
     `team(id).projects(first: 21)` with the operator-selected team's
     UUID. `install::pick_project_interactively` renders the list with
     "Create new project" ALWAYS appended as the final option (index
     N+1; option `1)` when N==0). >20 projects → first 20 + Create-new
     + warning row.

     `--project <UUID>` short-circuits S4 entirely (FR-044 fast
     path).
   - **S5 — projectCreate branch (FR-041).** Fires only when the
     operator picked "Create new project" at S4.
     `install::run_create_project_branch`:
     1. `install::prompt_new_project_name` — repo basename is the
        default (plan.md A6).
     2. Duplicate-name pre-check via
        `install::_handle_duplicate_name` — on a hit, prompt
        `[create-anyway/pick-existing/rename]` per
        [`install-prompts.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-prompts.md)
        §5.3. `pick-existing` (default) attaches; `rename` loops back
        to the name prompt; `create-anyway` proceeds to confirm.
     3. Confirm prompt `Create new Linear Project "<name>" in
        <key>? [Y/n] (default: Y)` (§5.4).
     4. `install::create_linear_project` fires the `projectCreate`
        mutation per
        [`install-discovery-graphql.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-discovery-graphql.md)
        §4. On `success: true` the install surfaces the project URL
        (no UUID per SC-010). On `success: false` it halts with exit
        1 + the verbatim Linear error.
   - **S6 — write linear-config.yml (FR-042).** Gate:
     `selected_team_id` AND `selected_project_id` must both be
     non-empty (the discovery flow guarantees this; the gate is a
     defense-in-depth check). `install::write_config` copies
     `config-template.yml` into
     `.specify/extensions/linear/linear-config.yml` and substitutes
     the resolved Team + Project UUIDs, the operator identity
     (FR-034 → `linear.operator.*`), and the workspace name + URL
     slug (FR-048 → `linear.workspace.*`). `workflow_state_uuids`
     remain zero — the seed step fills them.
   - **S7 — hook registration (FR-031 + FR-033) AFTER write_config
     (FR-043).**
     - Detects whether the target repo is the spec-kit-linear repo
       itself (the **dogfood guard**, T048). When detected, hook
       entries are emitted with
       `condition: "${SPECKIT_LINEAR_DOGFOOD_SAFE:-false}"` so they
       don't auto-fire during the bridge's own development unless
       the operator opts in by exporting that env var.
     - Registers each of the six `after_*` hooks under
       `.specify/extensions.yml` per FR-031 / Principle VII. Each
       entry points at `speckit.linear.push`, with `optional: false`
       and `enabled: true`. Re-runs honour any pre-existing
       `enabled: false` operator edit (Principle VII rule 1).
     - Installs `post-checkout`, `post-commit`, `post-merge` git
       hooks per FR-033. If a hook of the same name already exists
       (non-bridge content), the install chains a marker block
       (`# >>> spec-kit-linear hook begin (FR-033) >>>`) onto the
       end of the existing hook rather than overwriting it.
       Re-installs are idempotent — the marker is the detection
       signal.
   - **T063 — seed-state check (FR-022).** After resolving the Team
     UUID and writing `linear-config.yml`, the install inspects
     `linear.workflow_state_uuids`. If the map is absent or every
     entry holds the placeholder zero-UUID, the workspace is
     unseeded and the install prompts:
     - **(default) Y** — invoke `src/seed.sh --team <UUID>` inline.
       The same install invocation leaves a fully-seeded workspace
       and the captured workflow-state UUIDs land in
       `linear-config.yml`.
     - **n / defer** — install completes; the structured summary
       carries an FR-022 warning row and the Next-steps block
       directs the operator to `/spec-kit-linear-seed` before the
       first `/spec-kit-linear-push`.
     In `--non-interactive` (or `--no-prompt`) mode the install
     **halts** with the same FR-022 error rather than prompt, so CI
     never silently leaves the workspace half-installed.
   - **T064 — Action-install prompt (FR-027).** If neither
     `--with-action` nor `--no-action` was passed on the CLI, the
     install asks "Install GitHub Action layer? [Y/n]".
     - **Y** — copies `.specify/templates/github-action.yml` into
       `.github/workflows/spec-kit-linear-sync.yml`. Verifies the
       template exists in `EXTENSION_ROOT/templates/`; surfaces an
       error and bails (rather than silently degrading) when it
       does not.
     - **n** — skips the Action install; the operator can re-run
       with `--with-action` to enable Layer E later.
     Idempotent: if the workflow file already exists at the
     destination, interactive runs prompt before overwrite;
     `--non-interactive` runs preserve the existing file in place
     and emit a corresponding log row. After install (regardless of
     branch), the script surfaces the exact `gh secret set
     LINEAR_API_TOKEN -R <owner>/<repo>` command per FR-029. The
     bridge **does not** provision the secret on the operator's
     behalf. In `--non-interactive` mode without an explicit flag,
     the Action installs at the canonical path without prompting
     (the operator opts out scripted-runs via `--no-action`).

3. **Render the structured summary.** The script emits a
   `summary::emit` block to stderr at the end of every invocation
   (Principle VIII Rule 1 / FR-023). The block looks like:

   ```text
   ===== speckit.linear summary =====
   spec-kit-linear install ceremony
   Created: 2   Updated: 2   Archived: 0
   Skipped: 1   Warned: 0     Errors: 0
   ----- warnings -----
   - GitHub Action install (re-run with --with-action to enable Layer E)
   ==================================
   ```

   Surface this verbatim to the operator. The dependency report block
   that preceded the summary is also operator-visible — together they
   are the entire FR-018b contract.

4. **Handle the exit code.** Per `contracts/command-shapes.md` §5.6:
   - `0` — install completed; all required dependencies green.
     Show the summary and direct the operator to run
     `/spec-kit-linear-seed` next.
   - `1` — recoverable transient failure (e.g. Linear API blip
     during the deferred `--auto-create` Project bootstrap, when
     enabled). Re-run.
   - `2` — workspace-level config error. The script halted before
     mutation. Common causes (and the script prints exact
     remediation for each):
     - Bash 3.2 detected (`brew install bash`).
     - `jq` / `git` below minimum version.
     - Not inside a git repo, or `.specify/` missing.
     - `--non-interactive` without `--project` (or `--auto-create`)
       and `--team`.
   - `3` — transport failure. The MCP wiring step couldn't reach
     Linear / the operator's MCP host. Re-run when connectivity is
     restored.

## End-to-end walkthrough

The operator-facing prose for the full install ceremony — including
sample console output for each of the dependency-report rows, the
T063 seed prompt, and the T064 Action prompt — lives in
[`quickstart.md`](../specs/001-spec-kit-linear-bridge/quickstart.md)
§Step 1. That document is the source of truth for the operator UX;
this command markdown deliberately documents only the algorithm the
AI agent executes. When the two diverge, prefer `quickstart.md`.

## When this command fires

- **Operator-driven, one-shot.** This command is run **once per
  consumer repo** at adoption time. Subsequent invocations are
  idempotent (re-running just re-verifies dependencies and reports
  drift).
- **Not auto-fired.** Unlike `/spec-kit-linear-push`, this command is
  never wired to any `after_*` hook or git hook. It only runs when
  the operator explicitly invokes it.

## Output channel discipline

- `stdout` of `src/install.sh` is reserved for any future
  structured output (none in v1).
- `stderr` carries:
  - the per-step dependency report rows (`✓` / `⚠` / `✗`)
  - the next-steps pointer block
  - the final structured `summary::emit` block
- Filesystem writes are deliberate and documented:
  - `.specify/extensions/linear/linear-config.yml` (FR-002)
  - `.specify/extensions.yml` (FR-031 — `after_*` hooks)
  - `.git/hooks/{post-checkout,post-commit,post-merge}` (FR-033)
  - `.mcp.json` (FR-018b — Linear MCP entry, auto-added if absent)
  - `.github/workflows/spec-kit-linear-sync.yml` (FR-027 — only when
    `--with-action` is set)

No Linear-side mutations happen (other than the deferred
`--auto-create` Project bootstrap once T077 dogfood lands).

## Failure surface

Each failure mode is surfaced as a named warning or error row in
the dependency report (Principle VIII) before the install proceeds.
Selected named cases:

- `bash X.Y` — needs >= 4 → exit 2. Fix: `brew install bash`,
  re-open shell.
- `jq X.Y` — needs >= 1.6 → exit 2. Fix: `brew install jq`.
- `git working tree` — current directory is not inside a git repo
  → exit 2.
- `.specify/` — missing → exit 2. Fix: run `specify init` first.
- `.git/hooks/` — not writable → exit 2.
- `gh CLI` — missing → warning (install completes; degraded
  Layer D fidelity per FR-030).
- `Linear MCP OAuth` — no cached credentials → warning. Fix
  surfaced inline.
- `.env` — missing or `LINEAR_API_KEY` unset → warning. Required
  only for direct-GraphQL paths (seed, git hooks, Action local
  test).
- `--non-interactive requires --team <UUID>` — non-interactive
  guardrail per FR-002 → exit 2.
- `--auto-create requested; placeholder Project UUID written` —
  warning. The interactive GraphQL-driven Project create step is
  deferred to T077 dogfood. Re-run with `--project <UUID>` once
  the Project exists in Linear, or wait for the dogfood
  integration.
- `dogfood target detected` — warning. The repo is spec-kit-linear
  itself; hook entries get a `${SPECKIT_LINEAR_DOGFOOD_SAFE:-false}`
  condition marker so they don't auto-fire during the bridge's own
  development.
- `dogfood-safe mode active (SPECKIT_LINEAR_DOGFOOD_SAFE=1)` —
  warning. The operator set the FR-033b override so install
  proceeded into a workspace that may already carry spec issues for
  this project. Surfaced both in the dependency report (top of run)
  and the final summary (bottom of run) so the override is
  unambiguous.
- `workspace unseeded; --non-interactive cannot prompt` — error.
  T063 + FR-022: the workspace has placeholder zero-UUIDs for
  `workflow_state_uuids` and the install can't ask. Fix: re-run
  without `--non-interactive`, or run `bash src/seed.sh --team
  <UUID>` first and then re-invoke install.
- `workspace seed deferred; run /spec-kit-linear-seed before
  /spec-kit-linear-push (FR-022)` — warning (not an error). The
  operator chose `n` at the T063 prompt; install completed but
  reconcile will halt until the seed runs.
- `github-action template missing at <path>; cannot install Layer E`
  — error (T064). The bridge's own checkout is incomplete; the
  template should ship at `EXTENSION_ROOT/templates/github-action.yml`.
  Fix: re-clone the bridge or pull a fresh release tag.
- `source path equals target path` — error (FR-046). The operator
  ran `bash src/install.sh --dev` from inside the bridge's own
  checkout; the S0 self-install guard halts exit 2 before any
  filesystem write per
  [`install-flags.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-flags.md)
  §4. Fix: install into a different consumer repo (the documented
  `--dev /path/to/spec-kit-linear` form from `README.md` runs from
  the consumer-repo cwd, not from inside the bridge).
- `vendored .git/ detected at <path>` — warning (FR-049). The
  install source carries a `.git/` directory at
  `.specify/extensions/linear/.git` — typical of spec-kit-CLI
  `--dev` vendoring. Install proceeds; the next-steps block
  surfaces the `rm -rf <path>` remediation. The bridge never
  auto-deletes that directory (Principle VIII — operator consent).

## Related commands

- `/speckit.linear.seed` — one-shot per-workspace seed of workflow
  states + labels. Run after install but before the first push.
- `/speckit.linear.push` — the convergent reconcile. Runs
  automatically after every `/speckit-*` lifecycle command once the
  install has registered hooks.
- `/speckit.linear.pull` — read-only inspect Linear's current view
  (works from any worktree, never mutates).
- `/speckit.linear.status` — drift report (filesystem vs Linear)
  without actually issuing mutations.

See `contracts/command-shapes.md` for the formal contract on each
and
[`quickstart.md`](../specs/001-spec-kit-linear-bridge/quickstart.md)
for the end-to-end operator walkthrough.

## FRs surfaced

This command implements (in whole or in part):

- **FR-002** — per-repo `linear-config.yml` materialised from the
  template at the canonical path.
- **FR-018b** — structured dependency report on stderr; silent
  failures forbidden.
- **FR-022** — T063 seed-state check; halt in non-interactive mode
  when the workspace is unseeded.
- **FR-027** — Layer E GitHub Action template install (T064 prompt).
- **FR-029** — surface the `gh secret set LINEAR_API_TOKEN` command;
  the bridge does not provision the secret.
- **FR-030** — gh CLI dependency check (warning only; reconcile
  falls back to git-only PR-state hints).
- **FR-031** — register the six `after_*` hooks with `optional:
  false` under `.specify/extensions.yml`.
- **FR-033** — install `post-checkout`, `post-commit`, `post-merge`
  local git hooks under `.git/hooks/`.
- **FR-033b** — dogfood-safe mode via `SPECKIT_LINEAR_DOGFOOD_SAFE`;
  surfaced in the dependency report and final summary so the
  override is unambiguous.
- **FR-034** — operator-identity stamping; the FR-038 `viewer`
  response is persisted to `linear.operator.{user_id, name, email}`
  for assigneeId stamping on subsequent reconciles.
- **FR-037** — API-key resolution order (env var → `.env` → `read -s`
  prompt) at S1, before any other Linear-aware step; the optional
  "save to `.env`" path keeps `.env` in `.gitignore`.
- **FR-038** — single S2 `viewer { id name email … }` verification
  query; `viewer == null` / non-200 / `errors[]` halts exit 2 with
  the Linear API-key creation link.
- **FR-039** — S3 team discovery + numbered picker; one team
  auto-picks, zero teams halts, and the operator never sees or types
  a UUID.
- **FR-040** — S4 project discovery + numbered picker with the
  "Create new project" option always appended; the operator never
  sees or types a UUID.
- **FR-041** — S5 `projectCreate` branch; prompts for a name
  (repo-basename default), confirms, fires the mutation, and surfaces
  the new Project's URL (no UUID per SC-010).
- **FR-042** — all resolved UUIDs (team, project, operator) written
  to `linear-config.yml` at S6 BEFORE any hook / git-hook / Action
  step; quitting before S6 leaves no `linear-config.yml`.
- **FR-043** — hook registration, local git hooks, and the Action
  install run only AFTER the FR-039 + FR-040 (or FR-041) picks are
  confirmed; a later-step failure leaves `linear-config.yml` intact.
- **FR-044** — `--team` / `--project` fast path; both present skips
  S3 + S4 verbatim (after a quick validity check), `--team` alone
  scopes S4, `--project` alone resolves the team and skips S3.
- **FR-045** — `--non-interactive` (alias `--no-prompt`) suppresses
  every prompt; it requires both `--team` and `--project` or halts
  exit 2 with a pointer to the v0.1.1 ergonomics path (CI safety
  contract).
- **FR-046** — S0 self-install guard via
  `install::detect_self_install` (`cd && pwd -P` canonicalisation,
  no `realpath` dependency); halts exit 2 when SOURCE ==
  TARGET. See
  [`install-flags.md`](../specs/002-install-ergonomics/contracts/install-flags.md)
  §4 for the verbatim message.
- **FR-047** — operator-facing install commands documented in
  [`README.md`](../README.md) §Install. The `--from
  <archive-zip-URL>` form is the canonical pre-catalog path; the
  `--dev <path>` form runs from a separate consumer repo (FR-046
  bars source-equals-target).
- **FR-048** — viewer-query reuse; the FR-038 response is the only
  `viewer` round trip — it also satisfies FR-034 (no second query).
- **FR-049** — vendored `.git/` detection via
  `install::detect_vendored_git`; warns in the dependency report
  and the final summary's next-steps block, never auto-deletes
  (Principle VIII).
- **Principle V** — UUID binding gate; the install captures Team +
  Project UUIDs so every subsequent operation resolves by UUID.
- **Principle VI** — OAuth-first via the Linear MCP; long-lived
  `LINEAR_API_KEY` only appears at the edges (seed, git hooks, the
  GitHub Action).
- **Principle VII** — re-runs preserve operator `enabled: false`
  edits on registered hooks.
